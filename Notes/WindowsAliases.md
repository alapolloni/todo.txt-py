## How to get Unix like alias in Windows##
1. SAVE AS this [file](https://raw.github.com/alapolloni/todo.txt-py/master/Notes/autorun_registryupdate.reg) and run it..  It will update your registry to automatically source autorun.bat from your home directory (IE: %HOME% , C:\Users\\{you}\\).
2. SAVE AS [autorun.bat](https://raw.github.com/alapolloni/todo.txt-py/master/Notes/autorun.bat) to %HOME%.
3. Open a new cmd.exe
4. Look at autorun.bat.  It should be self explanatory how to add more aliases.
